# Multi-Class Text Classifier

This is a multi-class text classifier that was trained on a [customer support dataset](https://blog.bitext.com/free-customer-support-dataset) 
which contained customer utterances and associated categories. It should be able to make reasonably accurate 
predictions on unseen customer utterances and categorise the utterance as one of the following categories.

    const request = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/classify', {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        body: {
            utterance: "i need help talking to a human agent" 
        }
    });

    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
} catch (err) {
    console.err(err);
}
````

### Response
````json
{
  "utterance": "i need help talking to a human agent",
